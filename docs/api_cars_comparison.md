# **Feasibility Analysis for Vehicle Data Integration**

## **1. Available data sources**

- **Public APIs (Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book):** Structured access to makes, models, prices and specs; free at entry level with monthly quotas and API key registration.
- **Web scraping (Consumer Reports, Car & Driver, Motor Trend, U.S. News):** Can extract visible content but typically prohibited or restricted by each site’s Terms of Service; carries risk of IP blocks or legal notices.
- **OpenAI Search:** Managed search service that indexes and retrieves relevant snippets from diverse sources (web, documents, internal data); eliminates direct scraping and simplifies authentication.

## **2. Legal and ownership aspects**

- **Official APIs:** Governed by their own Terms of Service; storing and modifying retrieved data is generally allowed within quota limits.
- **Scraping:** Often violates site ToS, exposing you to sanctions or legal claims from content owners.
- **OpenAI Search:** Outputs can be stored and transformed under OpenAI’s terms, with lower exposure to third-party conflicts.

## **3. Liability and risks**

- **APIs:** Exceeding quotas or misusing keys may suspend your access but rare legal action externally.
- **Scraping:** High compliance risk; no guarantee of continuity or indemnification.
- **OpenAI Search:** Offered “as-is” in preview; no indemnity for beta, but centralized service reduces external liabilities.

## **4. Operational costs and complexity**

- **Multiple APIs:** Requires maintaining many integrations, key rotations, quota management and custom logic.
- **Scraping:** Fragile against site changes; demands ongoing maintenance and anti-blocking measures.
- **OpenAI Search:** Single integration, scalable, unified query interface—dramatically simplifies your data pipeline.

> **Decision Result:** We opt to integrate **OpenAI Search**, enabling rapid deployment without juggling multiple APIs or risking scraping-related legal issues.
